The aim of the project is to create a visualizer to visualize computer netwoek algorithm.
In this we are beginning with the ford fulkerson algorithm.
The home.html takes input from user and the index.html gives the visualizing effect.
We use cytoscape.js library for generating the graph

Update3 is the current latest verson.
  We aren't able to merge the input and the graph 
  The graph shows bfs algorithm and not ford fulkerson(need to be implemented).
